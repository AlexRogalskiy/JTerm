Changelog entry:

[6/12/2017-14:52 0.3.0 Sergix]
	Entering "cd /" only adds a slash ('/') to the current working directory (which is still valid, but not what the user desires
	and can potentially cause confusion.)
	Entering a single slash now changes the directory to the highest-level directory available.
	Wrote documentation for version "0.3.1".
	Updated source builds and JAR builds.
	Created version changelog and release notes.
	Put License commenting in the source code.
	Opened a PR and requested for merging into master.

Full changes include:
	- Created JTerm.Parse() function that is the dedicated command parser (called by JTerm.Standby())
	- Added checking for blank input in the Parse() function
	- Entering an invalid command now outputs "Unknown Command '(command)'"
	- Window() class changes
		- Window.ToggleVisible() function that toggles the visibility of the window
		- Window.visible property (private) (visibility is automatically set to false)
		- Added command option [-v] which turns on visibility of the window
		- Fixed possible issue with the Window title being null
		- Window.GetTitle() returns title of the window
		- Window.title property (private)
	- GNU General Public License comments were put at the head of each source file in the project
	- When opening the terminal, a quick note about JTerm's license is displayed, along with JTerm's version and authors

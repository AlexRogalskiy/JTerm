	Uploaded pre-release jar.
	No big changes in source code since last update.
	Changed .gitignore to not ignore .jars.
	Pushed to GitHub along with associated source and changelog.

	Finally reformatted the directory.
	Created a 'jterm' subfolder under /src that is used as the 'package' directory for eclipse.
	Class files are generated in the /src/jterm folder (the same folder as the source files).
	Went ahead and removed compile.bat, as it is now useless. :P
	Added some comments to JTerm.java for more explanation.
	Created a .gitignore for files. NOTE: zipped files (.rar, .zip) can no longer be uploaded. Create a separate branch for changes.
	Updated the README for a change in the "Changelog" section: changelog entries must be indented (as now shown.) This adds for better readability.
	Pushed updates to GitHub.

	Edited uploaded files by NCSGeek.
	Eclipse generated some weird files... gonna have to rework the directory.

[5/16/2017-17:05 pre-alpha Sergix]
	Created classpath and source directory.
	Created .vscode settings folder for VSCode preferences.
	compile.bat automatically builds classes and runs it in the console.
	Only issue at the moment is getting JARs to work for a console application, if it is even possible. Typically JARs are only used for GUI applications.
	Pushed updates to GitHub.

[5/15/2017-8:55 pre-alpha Sergix]
	Uploaded the global changelog file to the project.
	Changed README.md "Changelog" section to require username in changelog entries.
	New entires in the changelog must be placed at the top of the file, rather than the bottom.
	Renamed my GitHub profile to simply "Sergix" rather than "Sergix7440."

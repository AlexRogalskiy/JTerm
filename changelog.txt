Created classpath and source directory.
Created .vscode settings folder for VSCode preferences.
compile.bat automatically builds classes and runs it in the console.
Only issue at the moment is getting JARs to work for a console application, if it is even possible. Typically JARs are only used for GUI applications.
Pushed updates to GitHub.

[5/15/2017-8:55 pre-alpha Sergix]
Uploaded the global changelog file to the project.
Changed README.md "Changelog" section to require username in changelog entries.
New entires in the changelog must be placed at the top of the file, rather than the bottom.
Renamed my GitHub profile to simply "Sergix" rather than "Sergix7440."

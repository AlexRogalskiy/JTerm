	Made some changes to compile.sh for Travis builds.
	Changes to the file are no longer necessary as long as all source files stay in the current folder.
	Pushed updates to Git.

[5/19/2017-20:06 pre-alpha Sergix]
	Input is now read as an entire line (via BufferedReader) and then iterated through as smaller "tokens" or substrings, using spaces as delimiters.
	Removed class files from the Git folder, but keep them in your local project folder.
	Changed .gitignore to reject .class files.
	Pushed updates to Git.

[5/19/2017-19:47 pre-alpha Sergix]
	Actually got Travis CI to work. Made a custom shell script that compiles the classes into the build/classes folder.
	Added the compile.sh file for CI build scripts.
	Updated .travis.yml to work with the new parameters.
	Changed README to include build status image from Travis CI.
	Pushed updates to Git.

	Attempting a different CI: CircleCI.
	Already started building the project... hopefully everything sails smoothly.
	Obviously, however, all issues are coming from Maven/Gradle, and I still cannot understand how to format the Maven POM or the build.gradle.
	There MUST be an easier way to deploy Java projects.... If anyone has any insight into this I am open to any suggestions.
	I'm probably going to give up on CI though. It's definitely nice for large projects, but Java does not seem to want to work with my CI.
	Removing all CI dependencies now, and closing all running CI environments.
	Pushed updates to Git.

[5/18/2017-17:02 pre-alpha Sergix]
	Updated Gradle Builds.
	The Travis CI at least WORKS now... sort of. I don't think it's actually building/deploying anything, as every time gradle runs it just reports "UP-TO-DATE" for everything...
	Working and past builds can be viewed at https://travis-ci.org/Sergix/JTerm
	Edited the directories for the java package.
	Pushed updates to Git.
	
[5/18/2017-17:02 pre-alpha Sergix]
	Created gradle dependencies.
	Pushed updates to Git.
	
[5/18/2017-16:46 pre-alpha Sergix]
	Been messing around with getting Travis CI to automate build tests for the project.
	Attempting to get Gradle to work.... with not much luck yet.
	Moved some directories around to hopefully work with the integrated builds.
	Pushed updates to Git.

[5/17/2017-22:03 pre-alpha Sergix]
	Finished the WriteFile class.
	Uploaded files to the Write-File branch.
	Opened a PR to merge to master.
	Pushed to GitHub.
	
[5/17/2017-21:38 pre-alpha Sergix]
	Added a logo to the readme, viewable online.
	Also added a project page at https://sergix.github.io/projects/jterm/index.html

	Created Write.java class file.
	Adds writing to files.
	Created "write" command in terminal.
	Pushed to Write-File GitHub branch.

[5/16/2017-19:52 pre-alpha Sergix]
	Uploaded pre-release jar.
	No big changes in source code since last update.
	Changed .gitignore to not ignore .jars.
	Pushed to GitHub along with associated source and changelog.

[5/16/2017-19:09 pre-alpha Sergix]
	Finally reformatted the directory.
	Created a 'jterm' subfolder under /src that is used as the 'package' directory for eclipse.
	Class files are generated in the /src/jterm folder (the same folder as the source files).
	Went ahead and removed compile.bat, as it is now useless. :P
	Added some comments to JTerm.java for more explanation.
	Created a .gitignore for files. NOTE: zipped files (.rar, .zip) can no longer be uploaded. Create a separate branch for changes.
	Updated the README for a change in the "Changelog" section: changelog entries must be indented (as now shown.) This adds for better readability.
	Pushed updates to GitHub.

[5/16/2017-17:36 pre-alpha Sergix]
	Edited uploaded files by NCSGeek.
	Eclipse generated some weird files... gonna have to rework the directory.

[5/16/2017-17:05 pre-alpha Sergix]
	Created classpath and source directory.
	Created .vscode settings folder for VSCode preferences.
	compile.bat automatically builds classes and runs it in the console.
	Only issue at the moment is getting JARs to work for a console application, if it is even possible. Typically JARs are only used for GUI applications.
	Pushed updates to GitHub.

[5/15/2017-8:55 pre-alpha Sergix]
	Uploaded the global changelog file to the project.
	Changed README.md "Changelog" section to require username in changelog entries.
	New entires in the changelog must be placed at the top of the file, rather than the bottom.
	Renamed my GitHub profile to simply "Sergix" rather than "Sergix7440."

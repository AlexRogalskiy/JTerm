[5/15/2017-8:55 pre-alpha Sergix]
Uploaded the global changelog file to the project.
Changed README.md "Changelog" section to require username in changelog entries.
New entires in the changelog must be placed at the top of the file, rather than the bottom.
Renamed my GitHub profile to simply "Sergix" rather than "Sergix7440."

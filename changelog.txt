	No big changes in source code since last update.
	Changed .gitignore to not ignore .jars.
	Pushed to GitHub along with associated source and changelog.

[5/16/2017-19:09 pre-alpha Sergix]
	Finally reformatted the directory.
	Created a 'jterm' subfolder under /src that is used as the 'package' directory for eclipse.
	Class files are generated in the /src/jterm folder (the same folder as the source files).
	Went ahead and removed compile.bat, as it is now useless. :P
	Added some comments to JTerm.java for more explanation.
	Created a .gitignore for files. NOTE: zipped files (.rar, .zip) can no longer be uploaded. Create a separate branch for changes.
	Updated the README for a change in the "Changelog" section: changelog entries must be indented (as now shown.) This adds for better readability.
	Pushed updates to GitHub.

	compile.bat automatically builds classes and runs it in the console.
